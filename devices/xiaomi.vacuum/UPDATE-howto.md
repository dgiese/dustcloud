## Hint:
There is a automatic tool to do the rooting and flashing. Look in the subfolders.

## Warning:
Do not flash Gen2 firmware to Gen1, and vice versa!

## Preparation
1. Install [python-miio](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio) (python3!)
1. Install ccrypt(apt-get install ccrypt)
1. Create custom image with imagebuilder.sh, Copy MD5 sum
	* you need to create your own ssh keypair and create an authorized key file
		* for Windows you might use PuttyGen to create the keypair
	* copy english.pkg and v11_xxxxxx.pkg into folder of the imagebuilder.sh
	* image builder needs to be as root (need to mount image)
		* if you use Windows: you need to run it in a Linux VM
1. Install local webserver and place created image into htdocs
	* do not change filename, it must have the format v11_xxxxxx.pkg
	* You may use also the integrated Python3-HTTP-Server
1. Connect the vacuum robot to the charging station

## Update
1. Put vacuum robot in unprovisioned mode (press WiFi button)
1. Connect to open WiFi of the robot(rockrobo-XXXX)
	* Do not connect to any other network (e.g. LAN)
1. > mirobo discover --handshake true
	* You'll retrieve the token (copy hash represented by placholder #Token for further use):
	* INFO:miio.device:  IP 192.168.8.x (ID: $) - token: b'#Token'
1. > mirobo --ip=192.168.8.1 --token=#Token_from_above# status
	-> should return status
1. > mirobo --ip=192.168.8.1 --token=#Token_from_above# raw_command miIO.ota '{"mode":"normal", "install":"1", "app_url":"http://#ipaddress-of-your-computer#/v11_#version#.pkg", "file_md5":"#md5#","proc":"dnld install"}'
	* replace ipaddress, version and md5 with your data ( md5 = copied md5 sum of  section "preparation" step 3)
	* Check status with command from 4)
	* Wait 10 minutes (you should see an access on your http server)
1. In case you get a warning about battery needs to be at least 20% charged: connect the robot with your charging station and charge it while updating. This warning can appear even if your robot is charged more then 20%.
1. If update is complete: try ssh access on 192.168.8.1 with user root


### Instructions on Mac OS
1. Install [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/)
1. Install python3: `brew install python3`
1. Install a python3 package manager like [pipenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/): `python3 pip install --user pipenv`
	 * You need to add the python3 installation to your system's PATH like it is recommended on the pipenv page
	 * e.g. `export PATH=$PATH:/Users/<yourUsername>/Library/Python/3.6/bin`
	 * set correct locales for pipenv, e.g. ```export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8```
1. Install [python-miio](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio) by going to the project folder of this repo and type `pipenv install requests` which will install all necessary requirements for python3. python-mirobo is outdated and isn't updated anymore.
1. Install ccrypt: `brew install ccrypt`
1. Create a ssh keypair: `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_xiaomi`
1. Create an `authorized_keys` file and place the content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa_xiaomi.pub in there: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_xiaomi.pub > <this-repo-path>/xiaomi.vacuum.gen1/firmwarebuilder/authorized_keys`
1. Make the imagebuilder.sh script executable: `chmod +x <this-repo-path>/xiaomi.vacuum/firmwarebuilder/imagebuilder.sh`
1. Install fuse and ext4 support to open the firmware images
	* `brew cask install osxfuse`
	* `brew install m4 autoconf automake libtool e2fsprogs`
	* follow [these instructions](https://docs.j7k6.org/mount-ext4-macos/).
	* `brew install ext4fuse`
	* The first time you'll mount an ext4 fs with fuse, it will prompt you to allow the extension (at least on High Sierra). Allow and retry the script, otherwise you'll need to use a Linux VM
1. execute `xiaomi.vacuum.gen1/firmwarebuilder/imagebuilder.sh` with a version number. The version number must be the same as the fw image you've copied to the folder. e.g. `./imagebuilder.sh 003094`
1. note the returned MD5 sum. You can see the md5 sum also in the output folder under v11_xxxxxx.md5
1. execute `pipenv shell` from the repo root folder to enable support for python-miio
1. Put vacuum robot in unprovisioned mode (Reset Wifi by pressing Power and Dock button for a few seconds until you hear "resetting WiFi")
1. Connect to open WiFi of the robot(rockrobo-XXXX)
	* Do not connect to any other network (e.g. LAN)
1. Execute `mirobo discover --handshake true` and note the returned token 
1. Execute `mirobo --ip=192.168.8.1 --token=#Token_from_above# status`
	* should return status
1. Go to the output folder where you've created your new firmware. Do this in a new terminal without `pipenv shell` as we'll want to use the integrated SimpleHTTPServer provided by Python. It is installed by default on your Mac.
	* Open new terminal
	* Go to the output folder with the new firmware
	* Execute `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
	* The content of the current folder is now reachable on port 8000
1. Place your robot in the charging station for the next step
1. Execute `mirobo --ip=192.168.8.1 --token=#Token_from_above# raw_command miIO.ota '{"mode":"normal", "install":"1", "app_url":"http://#ipaddress-of-your-computer#:8000/v11_#version#.pkg", "file_md5":"#md5#","proc":"dnld install"}'`
	* replace ipaddress, version and md5 with your data
	* The robot will notify you about the update. You should see outgoing traffic on your mac. You should see a request from the robot in the terminal where you've started the SimpleHTTPServer, e.g. `192.168.8.1 - - [29/Dec/2017 22:11:15] "GET /v11_003094.pkg HTTP/1.1" 200 -`
	* The robot will start to flash its white led indicating the update process
	* Check status with command from 4)
	* Wait 10 minutes until you hear the startup chime of the robot. You should hear the english voice now.
1. If update is complete: try ssh access on 192.168.8.1 with user root. Make sure you use your ssh private key corresponding to the one in the authorized_keys file
