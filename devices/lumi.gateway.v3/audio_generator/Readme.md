# Audio Generator for Xiaomi/Lumi Smart Home Gateway
It is possible to create new language files which can be integrated into the rooted firmware. To generate the language files you can use the `generate_audio.py` script in this folder.

It will read the content auf audio_xx.csv (whereby xx is a country language code like de_de or en_US) and use one of the supported engines to generate mp3 files for inclusion in the firmware. The language codes are the [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) format, so that the engine can use a voice with suitable pronounciation.

You'll notice that each engine has its problems with mixed langauges (e.g. german with english words in it). A little testing is necessary to find a suitable pronunciation.
