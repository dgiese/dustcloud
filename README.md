Welcome to our repository for reverse engineering and rooting of the Xiaomi Smart Home Devices. We provide you methods how to root your device without opening it or breaking the warranty seal (on your own risk).

The documentation of the devices (photos, datasheets, uart logs, etc) was moved to a new repo [dustcloud-documentation](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud-documentation)

Please take a look at the Dustcloud Wiki, which also contains instructions on how to root and flash your device: (https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/wiki)

# Communication for the community
Yes, there is a [telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/Fl7Mm0iEV7Pgf9ngDyly-g).

If you do not want to use telegram, you can use the [Matrix.to channel](https://matrix.to/#/#dustcloud:matrix.org)
or our IRC-Channel `#dustcloudproject` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/), which is bridged to the matrix channel. 

In theory you can contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/dgi_DE).

I am communicating announcements over all channels. 

Please inform yourself in the forums and with the howtos before you post in this channel. Otherwise your message is very likely to be ignored.
