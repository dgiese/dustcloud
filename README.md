Welcome to our repository for hacking and rooting of the Xiaomi Smart Home Devices. We provide you methods how to root your device without opening it or breaking the warranty seal (on your own risk).

We moved the documentation of the devices (photos, datasheets, uart logs, etc) to a new repo [dustcloud-documentation](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud-documentation)

Please take a look at the Dustcloud Wiki: (https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/wiki)
